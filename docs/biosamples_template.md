# Overview
This page will guide you through the process of submitting your samples to 
BioSamples in order to receive your sample accession IDs.  We have provided 
templates and tools to help validate your samples metadata.  If you have any 
questions about this process please contact [FAANG Data Coordination Centre](
mailto:faang-dcc@ebi.ac.uk) for 
help.

## Prerequisites
Please familiarise yourself with the [latest sample ruleset specification](
https://data.faang.org/ruleset/samples#standard) and 
the [FAANG data sharing principles](http://www.faang.org/data-share-principle).

**IMPORTANT: The data validation service is not compatible with templates 
prepared using Libre Office Calc, please use Microsoft Excel saving as xslx 
or Google sheets exporting as xslx.
