# Updating existing submission in ENA using the FAANG interface

To update existing ENA records, use the same submission template as the original submission. This process will update 
the experiment details with the metadata provided in your spreadsheet. 
Ensure that the spreadsheet includes the original alias used during the initial submission. Note that runs cannot be updated to reference different data files.
