### How do I get involved with the FAANG project?
Please register at the [FAANG website](http://www.faang.org/cgi-bin/host/misc/FAANG/mem) to become part of the FAANG community and 
join the working commitees.

### How do I submit sample, experimental ana analysis data to FAANG data portal?
The FAANG data portal displays sample, experiment and analysis data for 
livestock animals. There are [detailed instructions](index.md) on how to prepare and 
submit your data. These pages will guide you through 
the preparation of your data to meet the [FAANG metadata standards](https://data.faang.org/ruleset/samples#standard) and in the 
use of the tools that we have developed to support your submission.

### How to access FAANG data?
We provide two ways of accessing the data: one is through this [data portal](https://data.faang.org), 
the other is through [APIs](api.md) to access programmatically.

### Does FAANG have a Data Sharing Policy?
FAANG is committed to sharing data rapidly, before publication. All members 
have agreed to the [FAANG Data Sharing Statement](https://www.faang.org/data-share-principle) for pre-publication data 
release. FAANG is also committed to making regular public releases of primary 
and secondary analysis results to provide access to the wider community.

### I still have questions, how do I contact you?
