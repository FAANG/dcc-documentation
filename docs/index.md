# FAANG Archive Submission guidelines

All FAANG data should be rapidly released through the archives hosted at 
EMBL-EBI and NCBI as per the [FAANG Data Sharing Principles](
http://www.faang.org/data-share-principle). All submissions should 
proceed using the instructions provided within this documentation that uses the 
[FAANG validation service](https://data.faang.org/validation/samples) to ensure FAANG submissions 
meet the stringent [FAANG Metadata Standards](https://data.faang.org/ruleset/samples#standard).

Sample information should be submitted to BioSamples at EMBL-EBI, before 
submission of any experimental and/or analysis data to the corresponding archives. All these  
archives should be able to take the pre-registered BioSamples identifiers as 
part of a submission.
