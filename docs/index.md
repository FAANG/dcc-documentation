# FAANG Archive Submission guidelines

All FAANG data should be rapidly released through the assay archives hosted at 
EMBL-EBI and NCBI as per the [FAANG Data Sharing Principles](
http://www.faang.org/data-share-principle).

Sample information should be submitted to BioSamples at EMBL-EBI, before 
submission of any experimental data to the assay archives. All these assay 
archives should be able to take the pre-registered biosample identifiers as 
part of a submission.
