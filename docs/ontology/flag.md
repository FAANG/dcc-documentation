## Flagging ontologies

To flag an ontology as unsuitable, click on the **thumbs down** icon. Similar to when you verify an ontology, you can choose to associate a project. Click on **Next** to proceed to next step (with or without project selection), where you can suggest changes to the ontology text.

<p style="text-align: center; margin: 15px 0;">

</p>

After suggesting the changes, click on **Submit**. While the request is being processed, you will see the notification “Saving feedback…”. It can take some time for the request to be processed when suggesting changes.

</p>

Upon successful submission, you will see the “Feedback submitted!” notification as shown before. The table will be updated to reflect the incremented count against the thumbs down icon for the ontology. A new record will also be created with the suggested changes, and displayed in the table.
