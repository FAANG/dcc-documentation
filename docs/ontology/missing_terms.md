## Check/Add missing terms

The 2nd tab navigates to the tool that allows you to check for and add missing ontologies.

Enter ontology terms in the text box as shown below. If you want to search for multiple ontologies, enter one term in each line and click on the **Search** button.

Ontologies that already exist will be listed in the **Existing terms** section as shown below. You can edit/validate ontologies from this table in the same way as described previously.

If the term does not already exist, ontology matches for the term will be fetched from the Zooma ontology service, and displayed for each term as shown below.

For each term, select the match thatâ€™s most suitable by clicking on the checkbox on the row. Clicking on the checkbox opens a dialog box as shown below, which allows you to make further changes to the selected ontology. The step are similar to when editing ontologies. Click on the **Save** button after making the necessary changes, to save your changes temporarily.

You can further edit the selected ontology by clicking on the **Edit** button which appears for the selected ontologies only.

After you have selected ontology matches for each of the terms, click on the **Submit** button to add the new ontologies. Upon successful submission, the newly added ontologies will be displayed in the ontology table page.
