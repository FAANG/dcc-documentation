## Summary Statistics

The 3rd tab navigates to the summary statistics page which shows the project-wise statistics of the ontologies.

The **Created/Updated** counts indicate the number of ontologies associated with the specific project. The **Validated** count refers to the number of ontologies that were either verified or flagged for the specific projects. This table is updated whenever an ontology is added, edited or validated.
