# Ontology Improver

The Ontology Improver provides an interface to search, curate and edit ontologies, to facilitate the improvement of livestock ontologies through community effort.

## Ontology Table Page

The ontology tool page has 3 tabs as shown below. The first tab is selected by default and displays all the existing FAANG ontologies in a table.

</p>

The functionalities of the ontology table are similar to other data tables on the FAANG data portal. You can -
1. Search ontologies using the search bar
2. Filter by projects or ontology types
3. Sort by columns

In addition to these functionalities, you can also validate (approve or flag) the existing ontologies in the table. The number of users that have approved or flagged each of the ontologies are indicated against **thumbs up** and **thumbs down** icons respectively, as shown below.

</p>

Clicking on the info icon besides the thumbs up/down icons allows you to see the history of all creation/validation activity by users, along with the timestamp, as shown here.

When you are logged out, the validation buttons are disabled. You need to be logged in to validate or edit the ontologies. You can use the hyperlink in the login dialog box to register, if you do not already have an account.

Once you are logged in, the validation icons are enabled. You can also see an edit icon that allows you to make changes to existing ontologies.
