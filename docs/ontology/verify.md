## Verifying Ontologies

To verify an ontology, click on the **thumbs up** icon. You will then see an option to select one or more projects to which you want to associate this validation.

For example, if you think this ontology is suitable for project <em>AQUA-FAANG</em>, you can select this option and click on the **Submit** button to confirm validation. Project selection is optional and you can also submit without selecting any project. Upon successful submission, you can see the “Feedback submitted!” notification as shown below. The table will also be updated to reflect the incremented count against the thumbs up icon for the ontology.
